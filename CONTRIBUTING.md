## Code Style

- **TypeScript**: Prettier default formatting, no unused variables, strict mode
- **Python**: PEP 8, 4-space indentation
- No commented-out code or `console.log`/`print` debug stubs
- Async for all I/O-bound Python tools

## Pull Request Checklist

- [ ] TypeScript builds clean (`npx tsc --noEmit`)
- [ ] Python imports load clean
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or API keys
- [ ] If adding a tool: register in `agent/registry.py` and add declaration in `server.ts`
