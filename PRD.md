# PRD - Project Requirements Document

## 1. Project Overview
**Name:** Zarya
**Description:** An omnipresent, highly interactive, and expressive AI desktop assistant designed to provide an immersive, human-like pair-programming and OS-management experience. Zarya integrates seamlessly into the user's workflow with deep OS-level capabilities.

## 2. Target Audience
- Developers and power users operating on Linux (specifically Arch/Hyprland) and Windows.
- Users who desire a visually stunning, context-aware AI assistant that can see their screen and execute commands on their behalf.

## 3. Core Features
- **Immersive Visual Interface:** A dynamic, visually striking overlay featuring dark glassmorphism, cinematic video backgrounds, and expressive character animations that react to the AI's state (idle, thinking, talking).
- **Omniscient Vision (Screen Reading):** The ability to capture the user's screen in real-time, process UI elements using Tesseract OCR, and understand the user's current context.
- **System-Level Control:** A secure Python-based desktop agent capable of running terminal commands, managing files, and interacting with the OS on the user's behalf.
- **Voice and Audio Processing:** Real-time conversational capabilities with wake-word detection and synthesized speech.
- **Contextual Memory:** Long-term memory storage to remember user preferences, ongoing project states, and previous conversations.
- **Platform Agnosticism:** Core design supports both Linux (Wayland/Hyprland) and Windows via a Factory pattern backend architecture.
